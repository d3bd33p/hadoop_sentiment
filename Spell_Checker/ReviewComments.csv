1,"I started reading this book at 10 PM & finished at 6 in morning...enjoyed a lot...Chetan's one of the best.
I recommend everyone to read it...don't go by critics review; some people have habit of always criticizing things...look at the majority."
2,"I first read it a good six years ago and had loved it. I still like it. It is no literary masterpiece and it would be wrong to compare it with one. It is a dime novel and a good one. It offers a good, quick read - it is a page turner and keeps you hooked till the end. Good pieces of literature linger with you even when you have read the last word. This is not one of them. It does not leave any lingering impressions. You do feel a little good and warm when you reach the end. 
If you have to while away an afternoon or have a long commute or have to pass a long night or if you have watched the movie pick up this book - it won't disappoint; just don't expect to gain anything from it. "
3,"You have all the ingredients in here to make even the lamest reality show look like blockbusters. The author starts-off by admitting he lacks the grasp of the basic english language, and with his sloppy langugage and poor, 5th-standard-fail grammer it certainly shows. He might have as well admitted that he was undergoing a lobotomy being performed by a quack while writing this book; because short of that no one can believe this was written by person who has passed Class X. It is so replete with mistakes (and sheer stupidity) that one can barely finish a quarter of the book. "
4,"Absolutely the top of the shelf. 3 Idiots, the movie based on the book, despite all the money it made, was not a patch on the book. Sincere, honest, witty and poignant at the same time, the boo will assure Chetan Bhagat a place in Indian literary history. 
read it if you have not done so already."
5,"I started this book after watching 3 idiots . Except raju's falling from the college building there is no similarity. This book is for children who want to improve their language skills. NO STORY AT ALL.IT IS JUST LIKE A BIOGRAPHY OF THREE STUPID COLLEGE FRIENDS WHO STUDY NIGHT AND DAY TO REACH IIT AND THEN BLAME EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR MAKING THEIR LIFE LIKE HELL .SO U NO WHAT THEY DO? THEY STOP STUDYING!!!!
If this Is what Indians like I will never read any Indian author bestseller again ."
6,i have read it after watching 3 idiots.must say chetan had done a great job.much interestng and preety good story.thats why it worked for me.I have become a fan of chetan.Really bro u had a good past.really good.
7,"This book is about how Chetan really screwed his life at IIT. It is very ordinary, and anyone who says that it is awesome is simply dumb! However the book does hook you up in the beginning, but slowly it lets you go, and at the end it just kicks you out! The book has an horrible ending. One message is very true that Indian education has to change its way, especially IIT. But the book barely concentrates on that! What it concentrates on is that how 3 hippies bunk classes at day and drink rum at night."

10,"its a great book 

one must read it..............

chetan bhagat just write awesome books 

awesome and awesome...............

its a great seller book 
and written truly very good and fully awesome.....................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
11,"this book is very nice...i think it is the best book chethan bhagat has ever written. man it is an EXCELLENT,OUTSTANDING book.it contains tragedy,comedy everything.once you start reading you cant stop till it is completed"
12,"This is an epochal book (and those who went to major engineering colleges will specially identify with the characters). However, it is the only worthwhile book Chetan Bhagat wrote. ""Call centre"" was just bearable (though the ending was rubbish) and ""3 mistakes"" was complete rubbish aimed at becoming a script for a third-rate masala movie. Let us see if he has regained his touch."
13,"Hilarious and a bit nostalgic ! It will remind our old college-days. Chetan Bhagat, as usual, created a masterpiece. A must read for everybody."
14,"I read this book after seeing 3 idiots. So while reading, it was bit confusing in the beginning to catch hold of the characters. Felt good when I completed this novel with few tears in my eyes."
15,have no words to say abt this story .. really missin my clg life by readin this\..................................................................................
16,"i usually dont read books. But when i had to order a course book...it was worth Rs95 and in order to save Rs30 as shipping charge, i searched for the cheapest one present there. So, along with my coursebook, i ordered five point someone. After reading this one ,i can definately say i made the right choice! Amazing book, i must say. And the best part is, being a engineering studentr myself....i can relate myself to this book. I would say its worth reading :)"
17,"You will love the book totally because of the climax part.
Beginning is quite boring. Five stars for the way of story-telling. Hats off to Chetan Bhagat for that. But its not the best of Bhagat. 3 Mistakes of Life & 2 States are lot more interesting."
18,just aswome story .. read it a time before nd again now ... must read fr iit students .. hell of comedy nd story 
19,"it was superb,.. 
i love to read this when i started and finished in 2 days,..
simply superb,.. book packing was good,…"
20,"Chetan Bhagat is quirky, funny, witty and original in his first venture as a writer, it is a must read for every one between the ages of 17 to 22. It is expressive and feels as if it comes straight from the heart.

The characters are lively and real, we find them everywhere... The story is equally riveting. Value for money"
