###tdm.py : Term Document Matrix Program
A document-term matrix or term-document matrix is a mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents. 
In a document-term matrix, rows correspond to documents in the collection and columns correspond to terms. 
There are various schemes for determining the value that each entry in the matrix should take. One such scheme, we are using is tf-idf.
Term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. 
It is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining. 
The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, 
but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general.
